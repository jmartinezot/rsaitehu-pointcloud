Introduction to the Point Cloud Processing Module
-------------------------------------------------

The Point Cloud Processing Module is designed for auditing, sanitizing, and manipulating point cloud data using the Open3D library. Point clouds are essential data representations in 3D space, commonly used in fields like computer vision, robotics, and 3D modeling. This module provides key functionalities for assessing the quality of point clouds, removing unwanted data points, and performing spatial operations.

Core Functionalities
--------------------

1. **Point Cloud Auditing:**

   - Function: `pointcloud_audit(pcd: o3d.geometry.PointCloud)`
   - Description: This function audits a point cloud, providing detailed statistics such as the number of points, the presence of normals and colors, and whether the point cloud is empty. Additionally, it reports the spatial bounds (minimum and maximum coordinates) and checks for point uniqueness and finiteness.

2. **Point Cloud Sanitization:**

   - Function: `pointcloud_sanitize(pcd: o3d.geometry.PointCloud)`
   - Description: This function sanitizes a point cloud by removing points with non-finite coordinates and eliminating duplicates. If color data is present, the associated colors of removed points are also discarded. This ensures a clean and reliable point cloud structure.

3. **Point Cloud Subtraction:**

   - Function: `get_pointcloud_after_subtracting_point_cloud(pcd: o3d.geometry.PointCloud, subtract: o3d.geometry.PointCloud, threshold: float)`
   - Description: This function subtracts one point cloud from another by removing points from the first point cloud that are within a specified distance (threshold) of points in the second cloud. It supports point clouds with or without color data and ensures efficient spatial computations using KD-tree search.

Use Cases
---------

- **Quality Assessment:** Determine the properties and statistics of point clouds before processing.
- **Data Cleaning:** Remove invalid or redundant points from point clouds.
- **Spatial Operations:** Perform geometric manipulations such as point cloud subtraction to isolate or extract specific features.

These functions provide a robust foundation for working with point cloud data, facilitating tasks in 3D data analysis, environmental mapping, and 3D reconstruction projects.
